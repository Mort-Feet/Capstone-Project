Problem Statement:

In today’s competitive market, understanding customer behavior and effectively segmenting customers is crucial for businesses to optimize their marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and increase revenue. However, identifying high-value customers (High Spenders) and predicting their behavior remains a significant challenge due to the diversity in customer profiles and purchasing habits.

Objective:

This project aims to solve the following key challenges:

Customer Segmentation:

1. How can we effectively segment customers based on their demographic and behavioral data to identify distinct groups with similar characteristics?
2. Can we leverage unsupervised learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns within the customer data?


High-Value Customer Prediction:

How can we predict which customers are likely to become high-value spenders using the features derived from their profiles and behaviors?
What are the most important factors that influence a customer’s likelihood of becoming a high spender?

The primary goal of this project was to analyze customer data to identify key segments using unsupervised learning techniques (such as K-Means and DBSCAN) and subsequently predict high-value customers (High Spenders) using supervised learning methods. The project also involved extensive feature engineering to derive meaningful insights from raw data.

This project provided a comprehensive approach to customer segmentation and prediction, combining the strengths of unsupervised and supervised learning methods. The insights gained can help businesses better target their marketing efforts, optimize customer engagement, and increase revenue through personalized strategies.

Conclusion:

This project provided a comprehensive approach to customer segmentation and prediction, combining the strengths of unsupervised and supervised learning methods. The insights gained can help businesses better target their marketing efforts, optimize customer engagement, and increase revenue through personalized strategies.

Future Work:

1. Feature Expansion: 

Adding more features related to customer behavior, such as online browsing patterns, could improve model accuracy.

2. Advanced Modeling:

Exploring ensemble methods or neural networks to enhance predictive performance.

3. Real-Time Deployment: 

Implementing the model in a real-time system for dynamic customer segmentation and prediction.
